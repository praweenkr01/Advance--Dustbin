# Advance--Dustbin
A simple but useful project called adv Dustbin using Arduino is designed and developed here. Using this project, the lid of the dustbin stays closed, so that waste is not exposed (to avoid flies and mosquitos) and when you want dispose any waste, it will automatically open the lid. This project will be very useful for the people who were very rich or people who were feeling some uneasiness for touching the dustbin. This project can also be more implemented for our future usage. Various features such as durability, affordability, prevention against damage and maintenance issues are addressed when these dustbins are designed. But since the technology is new in India, proper awareness should be created among the public before it is implemented on a large scale Otherwise, sensitivity devices like sensors might be damaged due to rough action of the users.
